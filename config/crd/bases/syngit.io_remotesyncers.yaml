                            Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to.

                            For example:
                            'pods' means pods.
                            'pods/log' means the log subresource of pods.
                            '*' means all resources, but not subresources.
                            'pods/*' means all subresources of pods.
                            '*/scale' means all scale subresources.
                            '*/*' means all resources and their subresources.

                            If wildcard is present, the validation rule will ensure resources do not
                            overlap with each other.

                            Depending on the enclosing object, subresources might not be allowed.

                            "Cluster" means that only cluster-scoped resources will match this rule.
                            Namespace API objects are cluster-scoped.
                            "Namespaced" means that only namespaced resources will match this rule.
                            "*" means that there are no scope restrictions.
