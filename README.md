# syngit

syngit is a Kubernetes operator that allows you to push resources on a git repository. It leverage the gitops by unifying the source of truth between your cluster and your git repository.

## Description

Sounds cool, isn't it?

**What is the difference with the other Gitops CD tools such as Flux or ArgoCD?**

The main approach of these tools is to pull changes from the remote git repository to apply them on the cluster. syngit does the opposite : it pushes the changes that you made on the cluster to the remote git repository.

**Why do I need syngit?**

There is plenty of reasons to use this operator. It can be borring to make every modification only through the git repository. Applying manifests will return an instant result of the cluster state.

Basically, if you like to use Kubernetes with cli or through an UI BUT you want to work in GitOps, then syngit is the operator that you need.

**Can I use it to keep history of my objects?**

Another useful usage is the object logging. Automatic etcd snapshot can be setted on the cluster but it will log the changes of the whole cluster. As a DevOps user that only deploy application without managing the cluster, I want to keep an history of my objects throught commit on a git repository.

**I use an automatic reconciliation with my CD tool, do I really need to use syngit?**

By concept, both are not compatible. In fact, the automatic reconciliation will not have any effect because the changes made on the cluster are pushed on the remote git repository.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- helm version v3.0.0+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### Installation

For now, you can only install syngit using Helm. More information about the configuration can be found [wiki](https://github.com/syngit/syngit/wiki/Installation).

1. Add this github repository to your helm repos.
```sh
helm repo add syngit https://github.com/syngit/syngit.git
```

1. Install the operator
You can customize the values before installing the Helm chart.
```sh
helm install syngit syngit/syngit --version 0.0.2
```

syngit is now installed on your cluster!

## Use syngit

There is 3 custom objects that are necessary to create in order to use syngit. More information about the usage can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/syngit/syngit/wiki/Usage).

### RemoteUser

The RemoteUser object make the connexion to the remote git server using an user account. In order to use this object, you first need to create a secret that reference a Personal Access Token (and not an Access Token).

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: git-server-my_git_username-auth
  namespace: test
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  username: <MY_GIT_USERNAME>
  password: <PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

```yaml
apiVersion: syngit.syngit.io/v2alpha2
kind: RemoteUser
metadata:
  name: remoteuser-sample
  namespace: test
spec:
  gitBaseDomainFQDN: "github.com"
  testAuthentication: true
  email: your@email.com
  ownRemoteUserBinding: true
  secretRef:
    name: git-server-my_git_username-auth
```

Now, if you look at the status of the object, the user should be connected to the git server.

```sh
kubectl get -n test remoteuser remoteuser-sample -o=jsonpath='{.status.connexionStatus}'
```

### RemoteUserBinding

The RemoteUserBinding bind the Kubernetes user with the remote git user. This is used by syngit when the user apply changes on the cluster. syngit will push on the git server with the associated git user.

By default, the `ownRemoteUserBinding` field of the RemoteUser object automatically creates a RemoteUserBinding. The name of the object is `owned-rub-<kubernetes_user_id>`.

To get the associated RemoteUserBinding object, run :
```sh
kubectl get -n test remoteuserbinding owned-rub-$(kubectl auth whoami -o=jsonpath='{.status.userInfo.username}')
```

### RemoteSyncer

The RemoteSyncer object contains the whole logic part of the operator.

In this example, the RemoteSyncer will intercept all the *configmaps*. It will push them to *https://github.com/my_repo_path.git* in the branch *main* under the path `my_configmaps/`. Because the `commitProcess` is set to `CommitApply`, the changes will be pushed and then applied to the cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: syngit.syngit.io/v2alpha2
kind: RemoteSyncer
metadata:
  name: remotesyncer-sample
  namespace: test
spec:
  remoteRepository: https://github.com/my_repo_path.git
  branch: main
  commitProcess: CommitApply
  authorizedUsers:
    - name: owned-rub-kubernetes-<kubernetes_user_id>
  defaultUnauthorizedUserMode: Block
  excludedFields:
    - metadata.managedFields
    - metadata.creationTimestamp
    - metadata.annotations.[kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration]
    - metadata.uid
    - metadata.resourceVersion
  scopedResources:
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      apiVersions: ["v1"]
      resources: ["configmaps"]
      operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE", "DELETE"]
```

### Catch the resource

Now, let's apply this configmap :

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: test-configmap
  namespace: test
data:
  somedata: here
```

The configmap has been applied on the cluster and it has been pushed on the remote git repository as well!
